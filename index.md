  title: Learning Computer Science, Robotics and valuable STEM skills such as coding
  text: >
    The popularity of coding in school is growing rapidly following the jobs trend in industry. 
    Learning how to code at a young age can truly set up your child for a lifetime of success. 
    Since coding can be gamified, kids at early age can start learning how to code using visual coding interfaces.
    Programming a Lego robot, with inputs (sensors) and outputs (motors) can give all students 
    the opportunity to get into coding without having any prior knowledge in programming or robotics.
