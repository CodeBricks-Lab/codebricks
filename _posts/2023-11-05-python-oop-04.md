# 4. Encapsulation and Abstraction

This section will delve into more advanced topics of encapsulation and abstraction, two core principles of object-oriented programming that allow us to hide the internal state of an object and expose only what is necessary.

## 4.1 Advanced Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the mechanism that restricts access to an object's components, which is a fundamental principle to protect the object's integrity by preventing outsiders from setting the internal data of the component to an invalid or inconsistent state.

### 4.1.1 Name Mangling

Name mangling is a technique used in Python to prevent subclass from accidentally overriding the private attributes and methods of a superclass.

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Name mangling

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount  # Accessing the mangled name

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

acc = Account(1000)
print(acc.get_balance())  # Output: 1000
print(acc.__balance)      # AttributeError: 'Account' object has no attribute '__balance'
```

### 4.1.2 Using `@property` for Getter and Setter

Python doesn't have built-in support for private attributes, but we can achieve a similar effect using `@property` decorators to create managed attributes, also known as "getters" and "setters".

```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self, price):
        self.__price = price

    @property
    def price(self):
        return self.__price

    @price.setter
    def price(self, value):
        if value < 0:
            raise ValueError("Price cannot be negative.")
        self.__price = value

product = Product(50)
print(product.price)  # Output: 50
product.price = 30
print(product.price)  # Output: 30
# product.price = -10  # ValueError: Price cannot be negative.
```

## 4.2 Implementing Abstraction

Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation. It involves the process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user.

### 4.2.1 Abstract Classes

An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

# This will raise an error if instantiated or if the subclass does not implement the abstract methods
# shape = Shape()
```

### 4.2.2 Abstract Methods

Abstract methods are those declared in the abstract class, which have no implementation. Subclasses are expected to implement these methods.

```python
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.__width = width
        self.__height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.__width * self.__height

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.__width + self.__height)

rectangle = Rectangle(2, 3)
print(rectangle.area())       # Output: 6
print(rectangle.perimeter())  # Output: 10
```

Note that we cannot instantiate an abstract class that has abstract methods. This encourages a child class to implement the abstract methods, thus adhering to the abstraction principle.
