Meta has just launched a new version of their Llama models called Meta Llama 3. These are special computer programs that can understand and use language in amazing ways. The new versions, one with 8 billion parts and another with 70 billion parts, are really good at doing things like helping with homework, writing stories, and even coding!



Meta made these models even better than before. They made sure these models could think through problems better and give more helpful answers. They also made sure that these programs are safe to use and they listened to what people who make apps and software had to say to make them even more helpful.



Meta wants everyone to be able to use these new models, so they made them available to the public. This means that people who create apps or other cool tech stuff can use Llama 3 to make their projects better.



For those who make these kinds of tech projects, Meta has made some tools to help them get the most out of Llama 3. Theyâ€™ve also added some safety features to make sure the models are used in good ways.



Meta is excited to see what kinds of new and fun things people will create with Llama 3. They have even bigger plans for the future, like making the models understand and speak multiple languages and work with pictures and sounds too.



If you want to try using Llama 3, you can find it on Meta's apps like Facebook and Instagram, where it can help you do things like find information or create cool posts. Meta is really excited to keep making their Llama models better and to see all the awesome things people will build with them.
