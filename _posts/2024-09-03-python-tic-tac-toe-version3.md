# How to Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python (with Functions!)

Hey there! In this tutorial, we're going to improve our previous Tic-Tac-Toe game by introducing functions. Functions are a great way to organize your code and avoid repetition, which makes everything easier to read and maintain. If youâ€™re familiar with Python basics like lists, loops, and conditionals, youâ€™re ready to take it to the next level.

So, letâ€™s dive in!

## Why Use Functions?

In our first version of Tic-Tac-Toe, everything was in one big block of code. While that works for small programs, itâ€™s not ideal for scalability or readability. Functions help us:

- **Avoid repetition**: We wonâ€™t need to repeat the same blocks of code multiple times.
- **Make the code more readable**: Each function will have a clear purpose, making it easier to follow.
- **Easier to modify and debug**: When you need to make changes or fix bugs, itâ€™s easier to work with smaller chunks of code.

Letâ€™s get started by breaking our game down into smaller tasks that we can turn into functions.

## Step 1: Creating the Game Board Function

We need a function to display the game board. This is something weâ€™ll do multiple times during the game, so itâ€™s a perfect candidate for a function.

```python
def display_board(board):
    print("\n" + board[0] + " | " + board[1] + " | " + board[2])
    print("--+---+--")
    print(board[3] + " | " + board[4] + " | " + board[5])
    print("--+---+--")
    print(board[6] + " | " + board[7] + " | " + board[8])
```

This function takes the `board` as an argument and prints it in a 3x3 format. Now, instead of writing this block of code every time we want to show the board, we just call `display_board(board)`.

## Step 2: Checking for a Winner

In our original version, the code to check for a winner was scattered throughout the loop. Letâ€™s put that logic into a function. This will make it easier to read and modify later if needed.

```python
def check_winner(board):
    # All possible winning combinations
    winning_combinations = [
        [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8],  # rows
        [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8],  # columns
        [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]              # diagonals
    ]
    
    for combo in winning_combinations:
        if board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]]:
            return True
    return False
```

This function checks if any of the players has won by comparing the positions in the `board` list against the winning combinations. If thereâ€™s a winner, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

## Step 3: Managing Player Turns

We also need to manage which playerâ€™s turn it is and check if a move is valid. Letâ€™s write a function that handles the turn-taking process.

```python
def player_turn(player, board):
    while True:
        move = input(f"Player {player}, choose a position (1-9): ")
        if move in board:
            board[int(move) - 1] = player
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")
```

This function ensures that a player can only choose an available position. It keeps asking for input until a valid move is made.

## Step 4: Checking for a Draw

We need to check if the board is full and there is no winner. If all positions are taken and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

```python
def check_draw(turns):
    return turns == 9
```

This function returns `True` if the game has gone through 9 turns (which means the board is full).

## Step 5: Putting It All Together

Now that weâ€™ve created our functions, itâ€™s time to put everything together into the main game loop.

```python
def tic_tac_toe():
    board = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]
    player = "X"
    turns = 0
    game_over = False

    while not game_over:
        display_board(board)
        player_turn(player, board)
        turns += 1

        if check_winner(board):
            display_board(board)
            print(f"\nPlayer {player} wins!")
            game_over = True
        elif check_draw(turns):
            display_board(board)
            print("\nIt's a draw!")
            game_over = True
        else:
            player = "O" if player == "X" else "X"
```

Letâ€™s break down the main loop:

1. **Display the board**: The `display_board(board)` function shows the current state of the game.
2. **Playerâ€™s move**: The `player_turn(player, board)` function ensures that the player makes a valid move.
3. **Check for a winner**: The `check_winner(board)` function determines if the current player has won.
4. **Check for a draw**: If there is no winner and the board is full, the game ends in a draw.
5. **Switch players**: If nobody wins, the turn switches to the other player.

## Full Code with Functions

Hereâ€™s the complete code for the improved Tic-Tac-Toe game:

```python
def display_board(board):
    print("\n" + board[0] + " | " + board[1] + " | " + board[2])
    print("--+---+--")
    print(board[3] + " | " + board[4] + " | " + board[5])
    print("--+---+--")
    print(board[6] + " | " + board[7] + " | " + board[8])

def check_winner(board):
    winning_combinations = [
        [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8],
        [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8],
        [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]
    ]
    for combo in winning_combinations:
        if board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]]:
            return True
    return False

def player_turn(player, board):
    while True:
        move = input(f"Player {player}, choose a position (1-9): ")
        if move in board:
            board[int(move) - 1] = player
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")

def check_draw(turns):
    return turns == 9

def tic_tac_toe():
    board = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]
    player = "X"
    turns = 0
    game_over = False

    while not game_over:
        display_board(board)
        player_turn(player, board)
        turns += 1

        if check_winner(board):
            display_board(board)
            print(f"\nPlayer {player} wins!")
            game_over = True
        elif check_draw(turns):
            display_board(board)
            print("\nIt's a draw!")
            game_over = True
        else:
            player = "O" if player == "X" else "X"
```

## Conclusion

By using functions, weâ€™ve improved the structure and readability of our Tic-Tac-Toe game. Each function has a specific job, which makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain. This version of the game is more organized, and itâ€™s easier to expand with new features later on (like adding a replay option, AI opponents, or even network play!).

Now that you know how to break down a game into smaller parts using functions, you can apply this approach to other projects as well. Keep coding, and have fun! ðŸ˜„
