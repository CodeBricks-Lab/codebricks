We're going to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, just like the one we've all played many times before. We'll start by building the simplest version of the game, and over time, weâ€™ll improve it by introducing important concepts like object-oriented programming and networking. The Tic-Tac-Toe Iâ€™m introducing today is version 1, the most basic version. If you're familiar with lists, indexes, while loops, and if-else statements, you'll be able to make it. So, shall we get started?

# How to Create a Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

Hi there! Welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial on how to create a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. If youâ€™re just starting out with Python and want to build something fun, this project is a perfect way to practice your skills! Weâ€™re going to keep things really simpleâ€”no functions or classesâ€”just basic Python code that you can understand easily.

Ready? Letâ€™s jump in!

## Step 1: Setting Up the Game Board

First, we need a way to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board. For this, weâ€™ll use a 3x3 grid. You can imagine the grid as a list of 9 elements, where each element is either a number (representing an empty spot), or an "X" or "O" (the playerâ€™s moves). Hereâ€™s how we can set it up:

```python
board = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]
```

These numbers represent the positions where players will place their Xs and Os. Eventually, as the game progresses, these numbers will be replaced by either "X" or "O".

## Step 2: Displaying the Game Board

Letâ€™s write some code to print the game board so players can see whatâ€™s happening. Weâ€™ll arrange the board in a 3x3 format so it looks like a Tic-Tac-Toe grid.

```python
print(board[0] + " | " + board[1] + " | " + board[2])
print("--+---+--")
print(board[3] + " | " + board[4] + " | " + board[5])
print("--+---+--")
print(board[6] + " | " + board[7] + " | " + board[8])
```

This code will display the board in a way thatâ€™s easy for the players to understand.

## Step 3: Handling Player Turns

Next, we need to let the players take turns. Weâ€™ll use a simple loop to ask each player where they want to place their mark (X or O). Player 1 will always use "X", and Player 2 will use "O".

Letâ€™s write some code to alternate between the two players and allow them to choose their moves:

```python
player = "X"
game_over = False
turns = 0
```

Weâ€™ll use the `player` variable to track whose turn it is, and `game_over` to check if someone has won. The `turns` variable will keep track of how many moves have been made.

Hereâ€™s how we can ask players for their move:

```python
while not game_over:
    print("\nCurrent board:")
    print(board[0] + " | " + board[1] + " | " + board[2])
    print("--+---+--")
    print(board[3] + " | " + board[4] + " | " + board[5])
    print("--+---+--")
    print(board[6] + " | " + board[7] + " | " + board[8])
    
    move = input(f"\nPlayer {player}, choose a position (1-9): ")
    
    if move in board:
        board[int(move) - 1] = player
        turns += 1
    else:
        print("Invalid move. Try again.")
        continue

    # Check if someone has won or if it's a draw
    if (board[0] == board[1] == board[2]) or (board[3] == board[4] == board[5]) or (board[6] == board[7] == board[8]) or \
       (board[0] == board[3] == board[6]) or (board[1] == board[4] == board[7]) or (board[2] == board[5] == board[8]) or \
       (board[0] == board[4] == board[8]) or (board[2] == board[4] == board[6]):
        game_over = True
        print(f"\nPlayer {player} wins!")
    elif turns == 9:
        game_over = True
        print("\nIt's a draw!")
    else:
        player = "O" if player == "X" else "X"
```

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of what this code does:

1. **Display the board**: After each move, the current state of the board is printed.
2. **Ask for input**: The player chooses a position between 1 and 9. We check if the input is valid (i.e., the chosen position isnâ€™t already taken).
3. **Place the mark**: The chosen position is updated with the player's mark (either "X" or "O").
4. **Check for a winner**: We check all the possible winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals).
5. **Switch turns**: If nobody wins, we switch to the other player and continue the loop.

## Step 4: Checking for a Winner or a Draw

As soon as a player makes a move, we need to check if theyâ€™ve won or if the game ends in a draw. In our code, weâ€™re checking all possible win conditions:

- Three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- If the board is full after 9 moves and no one has won, itâ€™s a draw.

If thereâ€™s a winner, we print a message, and if all spots are taken without a winner, itâ€™s declared a draw.

## Conclusion

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve just built a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. Letâ€™s look at the full code all together:

```python
# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

board = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]

player = "X"
game_over = False
turns = 0

while not game_over:
    print("\nCurrent board:")
    print(board[0] + " | " + board[1] + " | " + board[2])
    print("--+---+--")
    print(board[3] + " | " + board[4] + " | " + board[5])
    print("--+---+--")
    print(board[6] + " | " + board[7] + " | " + board[8])
    
    move = input(f"\nPlayer {player}, choose a position (1-9): ")
    
    if move in board:
        board[int(move) - 1] = player
        turns += 1
    else:
        print("Invalid move. Try again.")
        continue

    if (board[0] == board[1] == board[2]) or (board[3] == board[4] == board[5]) or (board[6] == board[7] == board[8]) or \
       (board[0] == board[3] == board[6]) or (board[1] == board[4] == board[7]) or (board[2] == board[5] == board[8]) or \
       (board[0] == board[4] == board[8]) or (board[2] == board[4] == board[6]):
        game_over = True
        print(f"\nPlayer {player} wins!")
    elif turns == 9:
        game_over = True
        print("\nIt's a draw!")
    else:
        player = "O" if player == "X" else "X"
```

Now you have a complete working Tic-Tac-Toe game! Feel free to play around with it, try adding more features, or customize it as you like. Enjoy coding, and happy gaming! ðŸ˜„
