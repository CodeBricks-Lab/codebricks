# 2. Deep Dive into Classes and Objects

Understanding classes and objects at a deeper level will allow you to write more efficient, maintainable, and robust object-oriented code in Python. In this section, we will explore some advanced topics related to class attributes, methods, constructors, and destructors.

## 2.1 Advanced Class Attributes

### 2.1.1 Class Attributes vs. Instance Attributes

Class attributes are shared by all instances of the class. They're defined within the class but outside any methods.

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name            # Instance attribute
        self.age = age              # Instance attribute
```

Instance attributes are unique to each object (instance of the class); they're defined within the `__init__` method.

### 2.1.2 Using `@property`

The `@property` decorator allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes, which is useful for encapsulation.

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius

    @property
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius

    @radius.setter
    def radius(self, value):
        if value >= 0:
            self._radius = value
        else:
            raise ValueError("Radius must be non-negative")
```

## 2.2 Advanced Methods

### 2.2.1 Class Methods

A class method takes `cls` as the first parameter and can access class variables and modify class state.

```python
class Employee:
    num_employees = 0

    @classmethod
    def add_employee(cls):
        cls.num_employees += 1

Employee.add_employee()
print(Employee.num_employees)  # Output: 1
```

### 2.2.2 Static Methods

Static methods don't take the instance (`self`) or class (`cls`) as the first parameter. They behave like regular functions but belong to the class's namespace.

```python
class MathUtility:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

print(MathUtility.add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
```

## 2.3 Understanding `__init__` and `__new__`

The `__init__` method is the initializer that gets called after the object has been created, to set up instance-specific attributes.

The `__new__` method is the actual object constructor and is called first. It's responsible for returning a new instance of your class.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __new__(cls):
        print("Creating instance...")
        instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return instance

    def __init__(self):
        print("Initializing instance...")

obj = MyClass()
```

## 2.4 Handling Object Deletion with `__del__`

The `__del__` method is the destructor. It is called when the instance is about to be destroyed and can be useful for resource cleanup.

```python
class Resource:
    def __del__(self):
        print("Resource being released...")

res = Resource()
del res  # Output: Resource being released...
```

Keep in mind that in Python, the garbage collector handles memory management, so `__del__` is not as commonly used as constructors.
